What is Mutation Test? 

Mutation Testing (MT) is a fault-based testing, program mutation, error-based testing, or mutation analysis. As the name suggest, mutation testing a  software testing type that is based on changes or mutations. Miniscule changes are introduced into the source code to check whether the defined test cases can detect errors in the code. 

The ideal case is that none of the test cases should pass. If the test passes, then it means that there is an error in the code. If the test fails, then there is no error in the code, and the mutant was killed. Our goal is to kill all mutants. 

Mutation testing also helps to test the quality of the defined test cases or the test suites with a bid to write more effective test cases. The more mutants we can kill, the higher the quality of our tests. 

Mutation testing in some aspect is testing your actual Unit Test cases. 

What ? 

PIT runs your unit tests against automatically modified versions of your application code. 

When the application code changes, it should produce different results and cause the unit  tests to fail. 

If a unit test does not fail in this situation, it may indicate an issue with the test.
