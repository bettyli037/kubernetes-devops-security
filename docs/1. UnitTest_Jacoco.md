2. Configure Jenkinsfile and pom.xml file.
```
### Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build Artifact - Maven') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"
        archive 'target/*.jar'
      }
    }

    stage('Unit Tests - JUnit and Jacoco') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn test"
      }
      post {
        always {
          junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
          # jacoco execPattern: 'target/jacoco.exec'  ## Install the Jenkins plugin to use this.
