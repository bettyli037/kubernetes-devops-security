# Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks
* Sensitive information susch as the access keys, access tokens, SSH keys etc. are often erroneously leaked due to accidental git commits and git push.
* Pre-commit/Pre-push hooks can be installed on developer's workstations to avoid such accidenet.
* Work on pure Regex-based approach for filtering sensitive data.
* If developers want, they can bypass this step.

# Talisman â€“ Keep Your Secrets Secret
Talisman is an open source tool.
Taliman installs a hook to your repository to ensure that potential secrets or sensitvie information do not leave the developer's worksation.
It validates the outgoing change for things that look suspicious like potential SSH keys, authorization tokens, private keys, etc.


### Global Installation 
Talisman will thus  be present, not only in your existing git repositories, but also in any new repository that you 'init' or 'clone'.
https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/docs/installation/global-hook/
* Global - pre-commit hook
* Global - pre-push hook

### Single Project Installation 
Talisman will be rpesent only in a single git repository.
https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/docs/installation/single-repository/

* Single project - pre-push hook
```
# Download the talisman binary
curl https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/install.sh > ~/install-talisman.sh
chmod +x ~/install-talisman.sh

# Install to a single project (as pre-push hook)
cd my-git-project
~/install-talisman.sh
```
Examples:
```
mkdir sec_files && cd sec_files
echo "username=sidd-harth" > file1
echo "secure-password123" > password.txt
echo "apikey=AizaSyCqhjgrPtr_La56sdUkjfav_laCqhjgrPtr_2s" > file2
echo "base64encodedsecret=cGFzc3dvcmQtaXMtcXdlcnR5MTIzCg==" > file3
```

## talisman reports and ignore contents
Taliman works based on pattern matching.
Matching patterns such as encoded values, sensitive file content, file size, entropy credit card num, file name, etc.

1. Bypass/Skip Talisman Hooks `git push origin --no-verify`

2. Remove Talisman Hooks
remove the hook manually by deleting the Talisman pre-commit or pre-push hook from `.git/hooks` folder in repository.

3. To ignore particular file 
Create .talismanrc file.
Copy report content fileignoreconfig to .talismanrc.
